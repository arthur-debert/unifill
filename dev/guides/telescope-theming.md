# Improving Telescope UI for Unifill

Based on my research of the Telescope documentation and source code, here's
what's possible for improving the theming and UI of your Unifill plugin:

## Formatting Results

### Text Styling and Highlighting

Telescope allows for rich formatting of result items through its entry display
system. Here's what's possible:

1. **Bold, Colors, and Highlighting**:

   - You can apply different highlight groups to parts of your entries
   - Neovim highlight groups can define bold, italic, colors, etc.
   - Each column in an entry can have its own highlight group

2. **Font Sizes**:

   - Neovim doesn't support different font sizes within the same buffer
   - However, you can create an illusion of larger text by using Unicode
     characters like 𝗯𝗼𝗹𝗱 or 𝐬𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐟 variants

3. **Background Colors**:
   - You can set different background colors for different parts of entries
     using highlight groups
   - This is done by defining highlight groups that have specific background
     colors

### Implementation Approach

To implement custom formatting for your Unicode characters, you'll need to
modify the `entry_maker` function in your `telescope.lua` file. The key is to
use the `entry_display` module to create a displayer that formats each entry
with specific highlight groups:

```lua
-- Use the entry_display module to create a displayer
local entry_display = require("telescope.pickers.entry_display")

-- Create a displayer with specific column widths
local displayer = entry_display.create {
  separator = "   ", -- More spacing between columns
  items = {
    { width = 6 },   -- Unicode character (wider for visibility)
    { width = 30 },  -- Name
    { remaining = true }, -- Category and other info
  },
}

-- Entry maker for telescope
local function entry_maker(entry)
  -- Skip control characters
  if entry.category == "Cc" or entry.category == "Cn" then
    return nil
  end

  -- Format the name and category
  local name = format.to_title_case(entry.name)
  local aliases = format.format_aliases(entry.aliases)
  local category = format.friendly_category(entry.category)

  -- Create display function that returns formatted text with highlights
  local display = function()
    return displayer {
      { entry.character, "TelescopeResultsIdentifier" }, -- Unicode char with special highlight
      { name, "TelescopeResultsNormal" },
      { aliases .. " (" .. category .. ")", "TelescopeResultsComment" },
    }
  end

  return {
    value = entry,
    display = display,
    ordinal = entry.name .. " " .. (entry.aliases and table.concat(entry.aliases, " ") or "")
  }
end
```

You would then need to define custom highlight groups in your plugin setup:

```lua
-- Define highlight groups for the Unicode characters
vim.api.nvim_command('highlight TelescopeResultsIdentifier guifg=#ff9e64 gui=bold')
```

## Controlling Window Size

### Window Size Configuration

Telescope provides several ways to control the window size:

1. **Layout Strategy**:

   - Different layout strategies have different default sizes
   - Options include: horizontal, vertical, center, cursor, bottom_pane, etc.
   - The dropdown theme is particularly good for compact displays

2. **Layout Configuration**:

   - You can specify exact dimensions or relative sizes
   - Width and height can be specified as percentages (0.5 = 50%) or absolute
     values (80 = 80 characters)
   - Preview cutoff can be set to hide the preview when the window is too small

3. **Theme-based Sizing**:
   - Predefined themes like dropdown, ivy, and cursor have their own size
     settings
   - These can be further customized

### Implementation Example

To implement a compact window size similar to nvchad's theme explorer:

```lua
-- In your init.lua, modify the unifill function
local function unifill(opts)
  opts = opts or {}

  -- Apply dropdown theme with custom sizing
  opts = require('telescope.themes').get_dropdown({
    width = 0.5,        -- 50% of screen width
    height = 0.4,       -- 40% of screen height
    previewer = false,  -- No previewer needed for Unicode chars
    prompt_title = "Unicode Characters",
    borderchars = {
      { "─", "│", "─", "│", "┌", "┐", "┘", "└" },
      prompt = { "─", "│", " ", "│", "┌", "┐", "│", "│" },
      results = { "─", "│", "─", "│", "├", "┤", "┘", "└" },
      preview = { "─", "│", "─", "│", "┌", "┐", "┘", "└" },
    },
  })

  -- Rest of your unifill function...
end
```

## Common Practices for Window Sizing

For a Unicode character picker like Unifill, these are recommended practices:

1. **Compact Display**:

   - Use the dropdown theme for a focused, compact interface
   - Consider disabling the preview pane since Unicode characters don't need
     previews
   - Width around 40-60% of screen width is typically sufficient

2. **Centered Positioning**:

   - Center the window for better focus
   - Keep it relatively small to emphasize the search functionality

3. **Highlight the Character**:

   - Make the Unicode character stand out with bold and/or color
   - Give it more width than other columns for better visibility

4. **Responsive Design**:
   - Use percentage-based sizing (like 0.5 for width) rather than fixed
     character counts
   - This ensures the UI works well on different screen sizes

By implementing these changes, you can create a more visually appealing and
user-friendly interface for your Unifill plugin, making the Unicode characters
stand out and improving the overall user experience.
