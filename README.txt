unifill is a vim plugin to insert unicode characters.
it leverages telescope, that is it's written as telescope extension. 

we recommend the "<leader>+  iu" (insert unicode) :-), once that is pressed you get a telescope UI that can search unicode chars by the official name, any of it's common aliases and category, once selected the UI char will be inserted into your current buffer.

the unifill-datafetch python script automates the download and setup of the unicode data, but it's not required for the plugin distribution.
